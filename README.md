### Hudu M365 Automation
This is an Azure Function which will syncronise between Microsoft 365 and Hudu. For more details please see my blog post here: https://mspp.io/hudu-microsoft-365-integration-and-updated-magic-dash-v3/

### Copyright
This project utilizes some of the helper functions and approaches written by Kelvin Tegelaar from the CIPP project https://github.com/KelvinTegelaar/CIPP and is licensed under the same terms.


### Updates
#### Version 1.1
```
Added error handling for tokens
Added automatic token refresh
```

### Requirements
For this script you will need
1. A configured M365 Partner SAM Application. To set this up I recommend you follow this guide https://www.gavsto.com/secure-application-model-for-the-layman-and-step-by-step/
2. The following permissions added to your SAM application and granted admin consent:

| Permission | Type |
|--|--|
|Application.Read.All|Application + Delegated|
|AuditLog.Read.All|Delegated|
|DeviceManagementApps.Read.All|Application + Delegated|
|DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All|Application + Delegated|
|DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All|Application + Delegated|
|Directory.Read.All|Application|
|Group.Read.All|Application + Delegated|
|Organization.Read.All|Application + Delegated|
|Policy.Read.All|Application + Delegated|
|Reports.Read.All|Application + Delegated|
|SecurityEvents.Read.All|Application + Delegated|

3. Hudu API Keys.
4. M365 to Hudu Tenant mapping completed (Each default domain needs to be setup as a customer under the relevant tenant this script will help with that https://github.com/lwhitelock/HuduAutomation/blob/main/Hudu-M365-Links.ps1)
5. The names of the Hudu asset types for People, Devices and Mobile devices in Hudu.
6. A field called 'Microsoft 365' of type 'RichText' added to each of the above asset layouts
7. An overview company created and the name of it in Hudu if you wish to use that feature.
8. Links to your PSA / RMM if using a supported tool (Currently Halo PSA and Datto RMM).(If you would like me to add support to your PSA / RMM please let me know the URL format to open a link to a user / device and the location in the .card data from the Hudu API where the relevant ID that needs to be passed into the URL is stored)

2. Select functions on the left
3. Click on the HuduM365Trigger function
4. Click on the Get Function URL button
